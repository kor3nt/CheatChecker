# CheatChecker
Cheat Checker allows the administration to check a player. It is a simple plugin and easy to use.

Commands:
- /checker set - you set the location of the checking room
- /checker check <nick> - you teleport the player and you can check them
- /checker admit - the player pleaded guilty
- /checker detection - you have detected a player has cheats
  
All messages are configurable. The plugin has a blockade against the player's exit while checking. Penalties are given in hours and can be changed in config.yml.
